# characterizing-structure-tensor
This repository contains code for reproducing all results from the paper

Source code in Matlab is in the folder source, and needed data is in the folder data
Running 

main.m 

in Matlab will generate all graphs that were presented in the paper. The code contains two files that need to be mexed. Binaries are included for Mac OSX and Ubuntu, and the code has been tested on these platforms.
